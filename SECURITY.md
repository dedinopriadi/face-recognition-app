## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the Face Recognition App, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do Not Create a Public Issue**

Security vulnerabilities should not be reported through public GitHub issues, as this could expose users to potential attacks.

### 2. **Contact Us Privately**

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing us at:
- **Email**: [Your Email Address]
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Face Recognition App Vulnerability Report`

### 3. **Provide Detailed Information**

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact and affected users
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have any suggestions for fixing the issue
- **Environment**: OS, browser, Node.js version, etc.
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, provide a proof of concept

### 4. **Response Timeline**

We commit to:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days to assess the severity
- **Fix Development**: Within 30 days for critical vulnerabilities
- **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is available

### 5. **Recognition**

Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:

- Listed in our security acknowledgments
- Given credit in security advisories
- Recognized in release notes

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm update
   ```

2. **Use Environment Variables**
   - Never commit sensitive data to version control
   - Use `.env` files for local development
   - Use secure environment variables in production

3. **Regular Security Audits**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

4. **Monitor Security Advisories**
   - Subscribe to security notifications
   - Follow our security updates

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize file uploads
   - Use parameterized queries

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use secure password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Implement rate limiting

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement proper CORS policies

4. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Monitor for security vulnerabilities
   - Use lock files (package-lock.json)
